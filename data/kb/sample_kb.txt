## Security Best Practices
Always validate user inputs before processing. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. Implement rate limiting on APIs.

## Database Administration
Regular backups are essential. Full backups run every Sunday. Incremental backups run daily.
Database maintenance windows occur on Tuesday nights from 2-4 AM UTC.
Keep indexes optimized for query performance.

## Network Architecture
Our infrastructure uses load balancers to distribute traffic. Traffic is routed through CDN for better performance.
All data centers are in compliance with SOC 2 standards.

## Incident Response
For security incidents, contact the incident response team immediately.
Post-incident reviews should be completed within 48 hours of resolution.
All incidents must be documented in the incident tracking system.

## API Documentation
Rate limits: 1000 requests per minute for standard tier, 10000 for enterprise.
Authentication uses OAuth 2.0. All API responses are in JSON format.
Deprecation warnings are provided 6 months before endpoint removal.
